	This is a story about a man named Wilbert. One day, Wilbert decided to find the toolbox he used to use when he was a carpenter. He said to himself, "It reminds me of the good old days, but what happened to me now? It has been twenty years already." Making sure he is not disturbing Pepper, his pet parrot, he slowly took his steps into his basement downstairs.
	Unfortunatly, Pepper the parrot died two days later. The reason for his death is unknown but many speculate Wilbert's unsafe use of his toolbox contributed to Pepper's death. Wilbert decided that he will get a new pet. He bought a cat from a sketchy website online and named it "Cat".
	The cat was seen a few days later by a few neighbors along the street. Apparently it had ran away from it's owner and was searching for a safe place to hide. One of the kids decided to pick him up, thinking it was a stray, wanting to take it home. The kid asked, "Are you hungry?", to which the cat responded, "yes".
	The friendly neighbors tried to give the cat a mouse they had caught in their basement. Unfortunately, it was not a gluten-free mouse, and the cat had some very serious dietary restrictions. Forgetting that this particular cat could speak, the neighbors brainstormed for hours about what to feed it. After staying up all night trying to come up with an idea, someone finally remembered that they could just ask the cat what it wanted.
	The kid then asked, "Then do you want to drink some milk?" Then the cat said, "No I'm lactose intolerant." Still wanting to help the cat, the kid asked "Then what do you want to eat?" The cat told the kid compulsively, "I want to eat PEPPER."
	THE END.
